# Allkin

Allkin is a collection of 195 icons and 1 master symbol, which explores the power of design in times of peace and conflict. Whether on the front lines or far removed, users of Allkin can contribute meaningfully through symbolic gestures, expressing thoughts and messages for peace that cross cultural and language barriers.

Allkin is a free, open-source hand-based symbol language, available as artwork via The Noun Project
and as a font via Google Fonts and Monotype Fonts. Allkin means all human connection.
The system contains 195 hand gestures — aligned to the 193 UN member states plus two observer states. Symbols are organised into categories: fundamental needs, social signs, emotional indicators, and conflict and peace advisories. Combined, they enable expressive, purpose-driven communication that informs and encourages peaceful resolution.

Creating a universal system is no small task — and yes, a risky one. A gesture in one culture may mean something else entirely in another. Allkin embraces these differences, offering multiple gestures for shared meanings. We ask you to use the tool respectfully — and to contribute. As an open-source project, Allkin invites collaboration and dialogue. Access the GitHub repository (link) and expand the design space. Cultivate the differences that make our world so rich, and our nations so unique.
